# ChatApp
**ChatApp1**: Asp.net core 8 + Javascript + SignalR + RazorPage MVC project \
**ChatApp2**: Asp.net Core 8 web API + React.js + SignalR full-stack project 

These are  example apps from Microsoft Documents or another Internet source. \
In my opinion, the best way to learn a new framework or tool is from their official documents.   
Happy Coding! ðŸ«€

how to add a client library in Visual Studio? the following steps:
```
In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, and select Add > Client-Side Library.

In the Add Client-Side Library dialog:

Select unpkg for Provider
Enter @microsoft/signalr@latest for Library.
Select Choose specific files, expand the dist/browser folder, and select signalr.js and signalr.min.js.
Set Target Location to wwwroot/js/signalr/.
Select Install.
```

In  a real-time app, it needs both frontend and backend to work together, like in a restaurant. we have servers and cookers. sometimes the server orders food,  sometimes, when there are some issues, the cooker needs to notice the servers actively.
